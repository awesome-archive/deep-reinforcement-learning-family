# Revisiting CFR+ and Alternating Updates
Neil Burch, Matej Moravcik, Martin Schmid
## Abstract
The CFR+ algorithm for solving imperfect information games is a variant of the popular CFR algorithm, with faster empirical performance on a range of problems. 

It was introduced with a theoretical upper bound on solution error, but subsequent work showed an error in one step of the proof. 

We provide updated proofs to recover the original bound.
