# Abstract
Copying an element from a photo and pasting it into a painting is a challenging task. Applying photo compositing techniques
in this context yields subpar results that look like a collage â€” and existing painterly stylization algorithms, which are global,
perform poorly when applied locally. We address these issues with a dedicated algorithm that carefully determines the local
statistics to be transferred. We ensure both spatial and inter-scale statistical consistency and demonstrate that both aspects
are key to generating quality results. To cope with the diversity of abstraction levels and types of paintings, we introduce a
technique to adjust the parameters of the transfer depending on the painting. We show that our algorithm produces significantly
better results than photo compositing or global stylization techniques and that it enables creative painterly edits that would be
otherwise difficult to achieve.
